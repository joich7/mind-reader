Questions
Is page the same as state?
How do we transition pages with only Javascript? - we make a nextPage or setPage function to update our state object. 
Can I reuse the go button and change the click event on it to serve both purposes?
HTML/CSS
Atoms
Header (1, 2, 3, 4, 6)
Paragraph Text (2, 3, 4, 5, 6)

Organism
Go Button (1) - Goes to the second page 
Reset Button (2, 3, 4, 5, 6) - Returns to the first page (has icon in it)
Next/Reveal Button (2, 3, 4, 5) - Goes to next page
Scrollable Numbers panel (5)
Objectives
All multiples of 9 will get the same symbol to get the mind reader portion to work.
Only one single html element
Manage the state with JS
On a reload of the screen we should start at page 1
Variables
resetButton 
currentView - which page we’re on in the application
symbols - array [‘!’, ‘@’, ‘#’, ‘$’. ‘%’, ‘^’, ‘&’, ‘*’, ‘(‘] (length of 9)
we could write a function that randomizes them (this is a little stretch goal)
expands to 99 total (for loop)
pages
Array of objects
Use the index of the array to pick the object in the array to match the page we’re on
headerText - text content
nextButton - visibility / text
paragraphText - visibility / text

Functions
setPage()
Could be used on page 1 as GO Button
Then used on Pages 2-5 on the next/reveal button
When a button is clicked we update the currentPage in the state object to reflect the intended. 
Click on next button will increment the currentPage in state by 1
Click on the reset button will set the currentPage back to 1
reset()
create99Symbols()
let symbols = ['!', '@', '#', '$', '%', '^', '&', '*', '(']
let arr = []
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
    		arr.push(i + " " + symbols[i % 9]);
}
